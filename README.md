Function and Device as a Service Support for Edge Computing
TANDEM - Τ2ΕΔΚ-02825
Partner of the project: Intracom Telecom

The project aims at establishing a holistic solution for the support of Backend-as-a-Service (Baas) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud computing models at the edge of the network, namely for edge computing services. The project will focus on the design, implementation, validation and evaluation of an integrated platform aimed to simplify the establishment, management, control and monitoring of edge computing services.

Central in this quest are: (i) the ability to make use existing functions, modules in new edge computing services, essentially integrating existing solutions in broader service function chains, (ii) the ability to interconnect the overall service function chain components with locally available devices, so as to process the corresponding data, as well as potentially remote chain elements e.g., centralized cloud based application backends. These capabilities target typical edge computing environments with a particular focus on the Internet-of-Things domain, where the interconnection and management of local devices e.g., sensors, is a typical task. Characteristic examples of desired functions and local processing tasks, include data stream analytics for the extraction of simple statistics, as well as video stream analysis for object recognition and/or tracking e.g., parking spot availability, human or car detection.

The project aims to provide a boost to the development of such services by facilitating the integration of local devices as well as generic, but customizable, functional modules in a similar fashion to the Backend/Function-as-a-Service model, enabling the use of third party, mature software. The project will deliver a full-fledged prototype. To this end, significant and extensive extensions will be developed for the selected Kubernetes and EdgeXFoundry frameworks. At the same time, the project will further develop and deliver key functions including IoT (sensor) data and video analytics (object recognition), as well as widely adopted message queues that will facilitate interconnection and interfaces between service components.
